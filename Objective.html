My expertise and passion are inferential statistics and quantitative behavioral research. I hold a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from Texas Tech University, where I graduated with a perfect GPA of 4.0. My dissertation topic focused on investigating the effect of moral dilemmas' situational moral features on cognition using crossed-classified random-effects modeling.</p>
                                          <p id="ArticleParagraph">I have held several roles throughout my career, including Senior Analytic Consultant at Phase 5, Postdoctoral Researcher at UMN's HumanFIRST Research Laboratory, and Lead Statistical Consultant at Texas Tech's Psychological Science's Department and Graduate School.</p>
                                          <p id="ArticleParagraph">In addition, I have instructed several courses at Texas Tech University, including Statistical Methods, Experimental Design, Multilevel Modeling, Categorical Data Analysis, and Research Methods.</p>
                                          <p id="ArticleParagraph">My skills include a broad range of statistical and data analysis techniques, including reliability and validity analysis, ANOVA, regression, SEM, Bayesian analysis, multilevel modeling, longitudinal analysis, mediation analysis, survey design, and validation. I am also proficient in a range of software and programming languages, including SPSS, MPlus, R, SAS, Python, CSS, JAVA, and Microsoft Excel, among others.</p>

                      <p id="ArticleParagraph">As a Senior Data Analytics consultant, I made significant contributions to my previous organization by utilizing my expertise in market research consulting and developing my skills in data analytics. My swift integration into the team was attributed to my strong technical proficiency and my ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Shortly after joining the team, I was recognized for my exceptional expertise in statistics, and as a result, I was promoted to a higher position. This achievement not only reinforced my confidence in my abilities but also demonstrated my commitment to excellence and passion for delivering impactful results.</p>
                      
                      <p id="ArticleParagraph">However, after working for a year in market research, I have made the decision to seek new employment and transition out of my current position. I would like to emphasize that this decision is not driven by any financial or personal relationship factors. My decision to pursue new opportunities is rooted in my desire for personal and professional growth, as well as the opportunity to work on more challenging projects that align with my interests and aspirations. My eagerness to take on more challenging research problems is the driving force behind my decision to seek new employment. Although I gained valuable experience in market research consulting and successfully worked on a variety of projects during my previous role, I am now seeking a position that allows me to leverage my advanced statistical knowledge and skillset while tackling more complex research problems. I am excited to take on new challenges that push me beyond my limits and enable me to grow as a researcher.</p>
                      
                      <p id="ArticleParagraph">Furthermore, I am deeply passionate about engaging in research projects that align with my personal values and make meaningful contributions to philanthropic causes. While the projects I worked on in my previous role were intellectually stimulating and covered a broad range of topics, they were primarily focused on benefiting companies, and I did not feel a strong sense of connection to the research objectives. Thus, I made a conscious decision to pursue a position that would enable me to utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute to the greater good and create a positive impact on society.</p>
                      
                      <p id="ArticleParagraph">Despite my decision to leave my current position, I am grateful for the valuable experience and skills I gained during my time there. I improved my ability to produce high-quality insights and deliverables for research projects, even under tight deadlines, sometimes with just a month to complete them. This accomplishment has been a significant milestone for me, and it has greatly enhanced my effectiveness as a researcher.</p>
                      
                      <p id="ArticleParagraph">In conclusion, my decision to seek new employment is motivated by my eagerness to take on more challenging research problems and contribute to philanthropic causes that align with my values. I am confident that my dedication and commitment to excellence will enable me to thrive in my future endeavors and contribute to the growth and success of my next organization.</p>
