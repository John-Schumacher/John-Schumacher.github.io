I am a Cognitive Psychology Doctoral Candidate at Texas Tech University. I have expertise in experimental research and inferential statistical modeling.  

This site contains various statistical tools and lab materials I have created that may be of use to researchers/teachers. Note, that the obscurity of some of the tools is due to my preference to not recreate the wheel.

Excel Calculators
-----------------

* * *

### Johnshon-Neyman Instantaneous Slope of Quadratic Effect

This excel file provides the region of significance for the instantaneous slope of a quadratic effect in a regression. It also allows you to find the point estimate effect and confidence interval along any value of X. The math for this calculator was adapted from Miller, Stromeyer, and Schwieterman (2013). [Download](/excel/JNQ.xlsx?raw=true)



### Two by Two Contingency Table Relevant Statistics

This excel file provides relevant statistics for a 2 by 2 contigency table (e.g., Chi, Yule, RR, OR, Fischer’s Exact Probability, etc.). Only change yellow highlighted cells. All equations are lifted from Agresti (2013).  
[Download](/excel/TwobyTwo.xlsx?raw=true)



### Goodness of Fit Tests & Other Things for K by K Contingency Table

This excel file pprovides the goodness of fit Chi-Squared test and G-test for a contingency table. It also provides Cramer’s V and Standardized Residual values. This excel only allows for up to 10 levels of any of the two categorical variables. Only change yellow highlighted cells. All equations are lifted from Agresti (2013). [Download](/excel/chiG.xlsx?raw=true)



### M-Squared Test

This excel file provides the M-Squared test for a contingency table. This excel only allows for up to 10 levels of any of the two categorical variables. Only change yellow highlighted cells. All equations are lifted from Agresti (2013). [Download](/excel/MSQ.xlsx?raw=true)



### Gamma

This excel file provides the gamma correlation for a contigency table, along with relevant values that are pertinent to the formula. This excel only allows for up to 10 levels of any of the two categorical variables. Only change yellow highlighted cells. All equations are lifted from Agresti (2013). [Download](/excel/Gamma.xlsx?raw=true)



### Odds Probability and Log Odds Conversion Calculator

This excel file converts a probability, odds, or log odds to the other two forms. All equations are lifted from Agresti (2013). [Download](/excel/OPL.xlsx?raw=true)



### Simple Compound Interest Calculator with Equations

This excel file computes the return from an investment. [Download](/excel/CI.xlsx?raw=true)



### ARC Calculator for Free Recall Responses

This excel file computes the ARC for free recall responses of participants. Only change yellow highlighted cells. All equations are lifted from Nestojko, Bui, Kornell, and Bjork (2014). [Download](/excel/ARC.xlsx?raw=true)

Modified R Functions
--------------------

* * *

### Empirical Logit Plot

This document contains R code to get the empirical logit plot for Y on X when Y is binary. This code was taken from [Alex Schell](http://alexschell.github.io/emplogit.html) and was modified so that it contained the Agresti (2013) Adjustment to better handle continuous X variables. I have provided the original document which covers how to perform a logistic regression in R and SAS in case it is of use to any. The relevant R code and steps are highlighted.
