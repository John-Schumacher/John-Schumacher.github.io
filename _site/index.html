<h3 id="empirical-logit-plot">Empirical Logit Plot</h3>

<p>This document contains R code to get the empirical logit plot for Y on X when Y is binary. This code was taken from <a href="http://alexschell.github.io/emplogit.html">Alex Schell</a> and was modified so that it contained the Agresti (2013) Adjustment to better handle continuous X variables. I have provided the original document which covers how to perform a logistic regression in R and SAS in case it is of use to any. The relevant R code and steps are highlighted. <a href="/Word/EmpLog.docx?raw=true">Download</a></p>
