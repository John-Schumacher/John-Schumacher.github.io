      <h2 id="Multilevel Mixed Modeling">Multilevel Mixed Modeling / HLM </h2>

<p> This page contains my lab materials for Multilevel Mixed Modeling, otherwise known as Hierarchical Modeling. I taught this lab in the Spring of 2020. </p>

<p> The material consists of downloadable zip files that pertain to each lab week as it was originally taught. Relevant files in each of the zip folders include R, SAS, and SPSS data and syntax, review slides, and review notes. For clarification purposes, all syntax is annotated by me.  </p>



<p> The datasets and syntax were originally taken from West, Welch, and Galecki (2015) and Snijders & Bosker (2012). These datasets and syntax have been used by other lab TAâ€™s who taught the lab before me. All other materials (i.e., annotated syntax notes, review slides, and review documents) were created by myself.  <p>
<p> These materials are meant to supplement lecture material, which is not provided here since I did not run the lecture or create those materials. </p>
