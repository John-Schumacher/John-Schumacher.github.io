### Johnshon-Neyman Instantaneous Slope of Quadratic Effect
This excel file provides the region 
of significance for the instaneous slope of a quadratic effect
in a regression. It also allows you to find the point
estimate effect and confidence interval along any value of X.
The math for this calculator was adapted from Miller, 
Stromeyer, and Schwieterman (2013). [Download](/excel/JNQ.xlsx?raw=true)

### Empirical Logit Plot
This document contains R code to get the empirical logit plot for Y on X when Y is binary. This code was taken from <a href="http://alexschell.github.io/emplogit.html">Alex Schell</a> and was modified so that it contained the Agresti (2013) Adjustment to better handle continuous X variables. I have provided the original document which covers how to perform a logistic regression in R and SAS in case it is of use to any. The relevant R code and steps are highlighted.
